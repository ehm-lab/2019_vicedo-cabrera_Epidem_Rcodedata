### A methodological framework for health impact projections under climate change scenarios

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A methodological framework to estimate future health impacts under climate change scenarios based on a defined set of assumptions and advanced statistical techniques developed in time-series analysis in environmental epidemiology. The proposed methodology is illustrated through a step-by-step hands-on tutorial structured in well-defined sections that cover the main methodological steps and essential elements:

The material:

-   *01EstimationERassociation.R*, *02ProjExpHOutSeries.R*, *03DownscalingCalibration.R*, *04_05_06ExtCurveProjUncert.R*, and *07DemChangesAdapt.R* performs the various steps, consistently with the sections in the published article
-   *fhempel.r* is an additional R function to perform the calibration step
-   *lndn_obs.csv*, *lndn_rcp4p5.csv*, and *lndn_rcp8p5.csv* store the projection temperature data
-   *Codebook* is a pdf file with the codebook for the datasets above (detailed explanation of all the variables)
